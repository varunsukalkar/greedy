# Greedy Algorithm Problems – Solutions

Welcome to the **Greedy Algorithm Problems** repository! 🚀  
This repository contains efficient and well-structured solutions to various problems based on the **Greedy Algorithm** approach. These problems are commonly asked in coding interviews, competitive programming contests, and academic assignments.

## 📌 What is a Greedy Algorithm?

A **Greedy Algorithm** is an approach where we make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that these choices lead to the globally optimal solution. It is often used when the problem has the **greedy-choice property** and **optimal substructure**.
